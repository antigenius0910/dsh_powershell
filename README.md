# dsh_powershell
Using dsh to control multiple Windows machines' powershell as the same time

Linux enviroment has a lots of very hands on and open source tools which we are familiar with, is there any way to manage Windows machine from Linux enviroment?

After research, I've found Distributed Shell with Bitvise SSH Server might just fit my needs.

First, we spin up two Win7 VMs.

Second, we need to have ssh server running on our Win7 VMs, [Bitvise SSH Server](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-server) seems like a great choice since it has the ability to let us gain a powershell in stead of cmd.exe. After install, we import our RSA.pub into Bitvise SSH Server as follow.

Third, we follow [dsh - distributed shell on Mac OSX](http://michaelmasters.blogspot.com/2009/11/dsh-distributed-shell-on-mac-osx.html) and install dsh on my Mac. Make sure we have all the Win7 VM's ip in ~/.dsh/group/testMachines. 

```bash
bash-3.2# cat ~/.dsh/group/testMachines
192.168.133.21
192.168.133.22
```

For Distributed Shell you can add different group later on (e.g., NFS server group, workstation group, Domain controller group...) in order to separately control your servers group by group. By using dsh we can then quicky submit Linux command to Linux server farm and Windows command to Windows server farm without interference with each other.

Finally, both Distributed Shell with Bitvise SSH Server are in place then we could submit some powershell commmand to control multiple windows servers.

```bash
bash-3.2# dsh -g testMachines 'Get-EventLog system -newest 1| Format-List'
